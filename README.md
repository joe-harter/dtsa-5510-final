This repository is a companion to the PDF I posted for Week 5 of Unsupervised Learning at The University of Colorado Boulder. The same PDF is in this repo, but may be an updated version from my original upload.

To run this repository I recommend setting up a python environment with conda

This project uses Python 3.10. Create an environment with

```bash
conda create -n kaggle python=3.10
```

Activate the virtual environment with

```bash
conda activate kaggle
```

Install all python dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The data is from the 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl which is hosted on kaggle. The data can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025/data - you may have to sign up and accept terms before downloading it therefore I did not include it in this repository.
